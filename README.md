# Automatic MRI Cardiac Segmentation in Short Axis for Left Ventricular Endocardium
## Presentation of an automatic left ventricle (LV) segmentation algorithm 

The main aim of this study was to develop a novel and robust algorithm which can improve the accuracy of automatic LV segmentation in short axis cardiac cine MR images. Our algorithm comprises four steps which are as follows:
- Motion quantification to determine an initial region of interest surrounding the heart, 
- Identification of potential 2D objects of interest using an intensity-based segmentation, 
- Assessment of contraction/expansion, circularity, and proximity to lung tissue to score all objects of interest in terms of their likelihood of constituting part of the LV, and
- Aggregation of the objects into connected groups and construction of the final LV blood pool volume and centroid.

Note: This project was a part of the 'Sensors and digitization' course (Master's first semester).
